About the Code Sprint
----------------

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites software developers to the October 2021 OGC API Virtual Code Sprint, to be held from October 26th to October 28th, 2021. The code sprint will begin at 07:00am EDT on the first day, and end at 05:30pm EDT on the last day.

A pre-event webinar, lasting up to one hour, will take place on October 19th at 09:00am EDT. The webinar will set out the scope of the code sprint and provide an overview of the candidate standards.

The October 2021 OGC API Virtual Code Sprint will focus on the following draft OGC API specifications:

* The draft [OGC API - Routes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/routes) specification defines the behavior of a Web API that allows applications to request routes in a manner independent of the underlying routing data set, routing engine or algorithm. The API implements the draft [Route Exchange Model (REM)](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-001.html) and can be used to facilitate intelligent transport systems.  
* The draft [OGC API - Discrete Global Grid Systems](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/dggs) specification defines an API for accessing data organized according to a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). A DGGS is a spatial reference system that uses a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe. DGGS are characterized by the properties of their cell structure, geo-encoding, quantization strategy and associated mathematical functions.
* The draft [OGC API - Common](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common) specification describes the set of common practices and shared requirements that have emerged from the development of Resource Oriented Architectures and Web APIs within the OGC. The draft specification serves as a common foundation upon which all OGC APIs will be built. Consistent with the architecture of the Web, this draft specification uses a resource architecture that conforms to principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). The draft specification establishes a common pattern that leverages the OpenAPI specification for describing APIs.
